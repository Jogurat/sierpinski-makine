# Sierpinski Triangle by Team "It Works On My Machine"

This is the repo for the algorithm test for the "FONIS Hackathon 2022" competition.

It is a 2-part project, a all-frontend solution in Vanilla JS and a Discord bot made in Node.js.

You can find the hosted version [HERE](https://sierpinski-makine.netlify.app/).

For the Discord bot, you can use [THIS](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=949644847944437781&permissions=51200&scope=bot) invite link to invite the bot to your own server, OR you can join our server HERE and play around with it. üòÑ

To use the bot, type into any text channel the bot sees, the following command: "trougo [number]" - specifying a number from 0 to 8. An example: `trougo 3`.
If you prefer to use grammatically correct spelling, you can also use `trougAo 3`. üòÅ

The bot will reply with a randomly generated Sierpinski Triangle with a mix of blue, yellow, red and green triangles, as a PNG image.
